    "## Recommending songs\n",
    "In this module, we focused on building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users. We also built an exciting iPython notebook for recommending songs, which compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.\n",

    "In this assignment, we are going to explore the song data and the recommendations made by our model. In the process, you are going to learn how to use one of the most important data manipulation primitives, groupby. These techniques will be important to building the intelligent application in your capstone project."

    "The method .unique() can be used to select the unique elements in a column of data. In this question, you will compute the number of unique users who have listened to songs by various artists. For example, to find out the number of unique users who listened to songs by 'Kanye West', all you need to do is select the rows of the song data where the artist is 'Kanye West', and then count the number of unique entries in the ‘user_id’ column. Compute the number of unique users for each of these artists: 'Kanye West', 'Foo Fighters', 'Taylor Swift' and 'Lady GaGa'. **Save these results to answer the quiz at the end.**\n",

    "### Using groupby-aggregate to find the most popular and least popular artist:\n",
    "each row of song_data contains the number of times a user listened to particular song by a particular artist. If we would like to know how many times any song by 'Kanye West' was listened to, we need to select all the rows where ‘artist’=='Kanye West' and sum the ‘listen_count’ column. If we would like to find the most popular artist, we would need to follow this procedure for each artist, which would be very slow. Instead, you will learn about a very important method:"
