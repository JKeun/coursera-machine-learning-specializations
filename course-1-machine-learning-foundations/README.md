## Week 1

---
### 1. Why you should learn machine learning with us

### Old view of ML
Data -> ML Algorithm -> My curve is better -> Write a paper

### Intelligent Applications using ML
- Amazon -> Recommendation in Website
- Google -> Retargeting
- Netflix -> Recommender System
- Pandora -> Recommedation of Music
- Facebook, Uber -> Connect People

### The machine learning pipeline
Data -> ML Method -> Intelligence

### Case Studies
1. Regression -> Predicting house prices
2. Classification -> Sentiment analysis
3. Clustering -> Document retrieval
4. Matrix Factorization -> Product recommendation
5. Deep learning -> Visual product recommender

### Overview
- Frist course is about building, evaludating and deploying intelligence in each case study
- Subsequent courses provide depth in **models & algorithms**, but still use case studies
